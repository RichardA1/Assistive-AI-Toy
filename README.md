Hello everyone, my name is Richard Albritton, inventor and creator of NaviPal, the friendly open-source, low-cost robot reminder pal. I am launching a couple memecoins simultaneously on Binance to help fund the development of my vision: A simple, easy to use robot reminder friend for kids, neurodiverse adults and ... well ... everyone. 

If that sounds neat, keep reading.

## 🥰 Meet NaviCoin: A Meme for Robo-Friends

Creating robots takes time, materials, tools, and a lot of love! That’s why we’re doing a simulaunch on Binance and Solana. INaviPal represents all the positive energy and excitement of our robot project—like an electric hug, right in your wallet.

We’ll be holding 40% of the total supply, selling 20% to fund development, and saving some for the future. NaviCoin is a fun, meme-driven token with no utility, but it’s a way for you to show your support and become part of this journey!

## 🧠 About Richard Albritton

I built NaviPal to help my husband remember to take her pills. It worked so well, many people have asked me to keep working on the project and turn it into a platform anyone can use. My vision is to finance NaviPal via launching memecoins and to use the proceeds to build an open-source friendly robot factory.

## 👉 Roadmap

* NaviPal v0 & demo
* NaviPal Binance Launch <- We are here
* NaviPal website, docs and socials
* NaviPal Platform v1 (Whitepaper + Design)
* NaviPal v1 (More advanced)
* Navipal v2 (Humanoid)
* NaviPal robot sale (only for holders)

Our ultimate vision is to build our very own happy open source robot factory. 

## 👉Project Goal

<img src="https://github.com/rexsaurus/NaviPal/blob/main/navipal-purple.jpg?raw=true" width="700"/>

The goal of this project is to design an inexpensive hardware platform that integrates Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) with a Large Language Model (LLM). The device should run on a standard 3.3V rechargeable battery and support simple I/O interactions, including buttons, LEDs, haptic motors, and additional sensors for enhanced interactions.

## 👉FAQ

### Why launch on both Solana and Binance at the same time? Why not pick one?
Solana and Binance are two completely different communities. We believe NaviPal has appeal across the spectrum. We wanted to launch in both at once to maximize our community.

### How do I buy a NaviPal?
NaviPal will be a platform which anyone can assemble at home. We aim to create a community around NaviPal to work together to further the project. Ultimately, we hope to make NaviPal available for sale and shipping, but need to evolve the platform. This is all in our roadmap.

### How will the funds be used?
Funds will go towards design and manufacturing of the NaviPal. We will ultimately be producing open-source droids and humanoid companions. For now, our primary aim is to build the NaviPal project and platform, hire engineers and scale the platform.

### How much will NaviPal cost?
Less than $30, depends on a few things. We will know for sure closer to manufacturing time.
