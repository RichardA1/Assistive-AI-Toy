        <h1>Meet BinBin: A Meme for Robo-Friends</h1>
        <p>Creating robots takes time, materials, tools, and a lot of love! That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre doing a simulaunch on Binance and Solana. BinBin represents all the positive energy and excitement of our robot project‚Äîlike an electric hug, right in your wallet.</p>
        <p>We‚Äôll be holding 40% of the total supply, selling 20% to fund development, and saving some for the future. $BNBN coin is a fun, meme-driven token with no utility, but it‚Äôs a way for you to show your support and become part of this journey!</p>

        <h1>üß† About Richard Albritton</h1>
        <p>I built BinBin to help my husband remember to take her pills. It worked so well, many people have asked me to keep working on the project and turn it into a platform anyone can use. My vision is to finance BinBin via launching memecoins and to use the proceeds to build an open-source friendly robot factory.</p>

        <h2>üëâ Project Goal</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to design an inexpensive hardware platform that integrates Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) with a Large Language Model (LLM). The device should run on a standard 3.3V rechargeable battery and support simple I/O interactions, including buttons, LEDs, haptic motors, and additional sensors for enhanced interactions.</p>

    <section id="faq">
        <h1>üëâ FAQ</h1>
        <h3>Why launch on both Solana and Binance at the same time? Why not pick one?</h3>
        <p>Solana and Binance are two completely different communities. We believe BinBin has appeal across the spectrum. We wanted to launch in both at once to maximize our community.</p>
        
        <h3>How do I buy a BinBin?</h3>
        <p>BinBin will be a platform which anyone can assemble at home. We aim to create a community around BinBin to work together to further the project. Ultimately, we hope to make BinBin available for sale and shipping, but need to evolve the platform. This is all in our roadmap.</p>
        
        <h3>How will the funds be used?</h3>
        <p>Funds will go towards design and manufacturing of the BinBin. We will ultimately be producing open-source droids and humanoid companions. For now, our primary aim is to build the BinBin project and platform, hire engineers and scale the platform.</p>
        
        <h3>How much will BinBin cost?</h3>
        <p>Less than $30, depends on a few things. We will know for sure closer to manufacturing time.</p>
